# soc-siem-splunk-lab
## Overview
This project demonstrates a hands-on SOC SIEM implementation using **Splunk Enterprise** for centralized log collection, detection, alerting, visualization, and incident response.

The lab simulates real SOC workflows by ingesting logs from **Windows**, **Ubuntu Server**, and **Kali Linux**, detecting authentication-based attacks, and performing alert triage and incident analysis.
